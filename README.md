Hi, my name is Josephine, and this is my code for my physical modelling Arduino project 
for a teacher-student feedback system, the BEAM (Button-Enabled, Assessment Mechanism)
The code is written in C++ for an Arduino Mega. 

It is a prototype model designed for two students and one teacher.

## SOFTWARE
The only library needed to run this code is the servo motor Arduino library which is in the files
Please note that some of the values for the RGBs may differ depending on your hardware

## HARDWARE
The materials needed to build the physical model are as follows:
  - Arduino mega 2560 Rev3
  - 3x small breadboard
  - 1x micro servo motor SG90
  - 6x LED - 2 x red, 2 x yellow, 2 x green
  - 2x RGB
  - 7x pushbutton
  - Resistors
      - For colour LEDs
          - 6 x 330 ohm
      - For RGB LEDs
          - 4 x 330 ohm + 2 x 1K ohm
      - For pushbuttons
          - 7 x 10K ohm
  - 36+ wires
  - Power cable USB-B
    
  - You can add any decorations for the servo
    I used a horse, flag, and bell for the servo
    and a cardboard platform
    
There is a photo of the hardware setup in the files.
